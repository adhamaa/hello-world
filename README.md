# hello-world

hi i am adham intersted in coding and plan to pursue & strive it.
my favorite color is black.
i don't like noisy environment
i am a dracula
i have a big castle on top of the fuji mountain
i suck blood like mosquito
once upon a time in fuji mountain
i fell from stumbling a pebble on the road
then i heard a sound of woman crying
when i turn my head around
there was nothing there
and i got scared shitless!
huff and puff and blow the tree down
with my fart
after that there come a yell
and i heard "WTF is this smell"
then a sound of stumbling
i turn my head again there was a langsuir
with long hair and red eyes shining and glimering
refelcting the moon light
the end
